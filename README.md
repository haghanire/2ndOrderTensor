# 2ndOrderTensor
Visualization of a 2nd-order tensor with matplotlib and vtk format
Taking a 2nd-order tensor as input and visualize its normal components as the elongation of a sphere and its shear components as vectors. For this vector

tensor_matrix = np.array([[2, -0.5, 0],
                           [0.5, 1, 0.3],
                           [0, 0.3, 1.5]])
 we get
